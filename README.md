Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

For this game, I chose to use the Lil' Abner Sadie Hawkins Day for the theme.
To learn more about Sadie Hawkins Day and Lil' Abner, see: http://lil-abner.com/sadie-hawkins-day/.

## Meet the Player

This game is a takeoff on Sadie Hawkins day, where the girls chase the young
*	men. (See http://lil-abner.com/sadie-hawkins-day/)
*
*	The enemies are:
*    Princess
*    Cat-girl
*    Horn-girl
*    Pink-girl
*
* 	As the player, you are the boy.  Your mission is to reach the water without
*	being "caught" by a girl.
*
* 		1. Use the up, down, left and right arrows to move the player.
* 		2. If you are "caught", you lose a heart and have to try again.
* 		3. When you reach the top you "level up" and receive:
*    	• A new life (heart)
*    	• 5,000 points
*    	• 10 points for every millisecond below 5 seconds time that it takes to
*					reach the top
*			•	and...  Lookout.  Another girl joins the chase!
