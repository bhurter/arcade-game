===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## Game Rules
As the player, your mission is to reach the water wtihout being "caught" by a girl.

1.  Use the up, down, left and right arrows to move the player.
2.  If you are "caught", you lose a heart and have to try again.
3.  When you reach the water, you "level up" and receive:
	* 5,000 points
	* Bonus points for reaching the water within 5 seconds
	* and... Lookout! Another girl joins the chase!
